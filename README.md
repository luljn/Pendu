# Project title

Pendu.

## Description

This is the game of hangman, it consists of guessing a mystery word.
Written in C programming language.

## To run the code.

I used DevC++ IDE to realize this small project, if you want to run the code by yourself, 
you can also use it or any other you want, you should create a new project in your IDE,
and add all the files with .hpp or .cpp extensions that are here. 

## The application.

I pushed the app with .exe extension (for windows) so you can directly try it.
